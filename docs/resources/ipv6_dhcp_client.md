## Schema

### Required

- `interface` (String) The interface on which the DHCPv6 client will be running.
- `pool_name` (String) Name of the IPv6 pool in which received IPv6 prefix will be added
- `pool_prefix_length` (Number) Prefix length parameter that will be set for IPv6 pool in which received IPv6 prefix is added. Prefix length must be greater than the length of the received prefix, otherwise, prefix-length will be set to received prefix length + 8 bits.
- `request` (List of String) To choose if the DHCPv6 request will ask for the address or the IPv6 prefix, or both.

### Optional

- `add_default_route` (Boolean) Whether to add default IPv6 route after a client connects.
- `comment` (String)
- `disabled` (Boolean)
- `prefix_hint` (String) Include a preferred prefix length.
- `script` (String) Run this script on the DHCP-client status change. Available variables:pd-valid - if the prefix is acquired by the client;pd-prefix - the prefix acquired by the client if any;na-valid - if the address is acquired by the client;na-address - the address acquired by the client if any.options - array of received options (only ROSv7)
- `use_peer_dns` (Boolean) Routing table this route belongs to.

### Read-Only

- `duid` (String) Auto-generated DUID that is sent to the server.DUID is generated using one of the MAC addresses available on the router.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `prefix` (String) Shows received IPv6 prefix from DHCPv6-PD server
- `status` (String) Shows the status of DHCPv6 Client:stopped - dhcpv6 client is stoppedsearching - sending "solicit" and trying to get "advertise"  Shows actual (resolved) gateway and interface that will be used for packet forwarding.requesting - sent "request" waiting for "reply"bound - received "reply". Prefix assigned. renewing - sent "renew", waiting for "reply" rebinding - sent "rebind", waiting for "reply" error - reply was not received in time or some other error occurred. stopping - sent "release"

## Import
Import is supported using the following syntax:
```shell
#The ID can be found via API or the terminal
#The command for the terminal is -> :put [/ipv6/dhcp-client/  get [print show-ids]]
terraform import routeros_ipv6_dhcp_client.inet_provider "*1"
```
